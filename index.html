          <h2>Boiler Installation</h2>
          <p>
            Installing a new modern central heating system is a great way to
            modernise a property and increase its value. Whether you are
            renovating a property which requires new central heating or want to
            replace your home central heating with a more efficient system, we
            can manage the entire project from start to finish. 
          </p>
          <p>
            NHPS understand the importance of ensuring your domestic boiler
            installation is carried out with the upmost care and attention. A
            boiler is one of the most important and expensive investments you
            will make in your home and to ensure the domestic boiler is the
            correct fit for your needs and home, operates efficiently and lasts
            and I always advise it is installed by a reputable and qualified Gas
            Safe Engineer. Being a multi-skilled gas/heating engineer I can
            provide a solution to almost any domestic boiler problem.

          <h2>Powerflushing</h2>
          <p>
            Powerflushing is a cleansing process which aim to remove deposits of
            sludge, rust and any other debris from your central heating system.
            If left, these contaminants can impact the efficiency of the system
            and cause irreversible damage.
          </p>
          <p>
            NHPS use up to date powerflushing machine with magnetic filters and
            chemicals to breakdown and remove these contaminants from your
            central heating system to leave it running as efficiently as
            possible, prevent breakdowns and increase the lifespan of your
            boiler.

          <h2>Bathroom Renovations</h2>
          <p>
            Family bathroom, en suite or cloakroom, I can create a space that
            matches your style and the way you live. Perhaps your existing
            bathroom needs modernising, or maybe you have extended your home and
            created a new bathroom. Choose your fixtures and fittings or let me
            design your dream bathroom, then seat back and let me install your
            new bathroom from start to finish.
          </p>
          <p>
            A bathroom is more than just its fixtures and fittings, so I can
            also take care of other elements like tiling and lighting, as well
            as finishing touches to make your bathroom unique. All tiling and
            electrics are completed in-house, and I also work with a selection
            of trusted partners in building and flooring who can help bring your
            plans for your bathroom to life.
